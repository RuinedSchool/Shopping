#  Short description:
This is a practice-challenge project. In it, we categorized a store with electrical products, separated the brands. Our products are few at the moment, but they will soon increase and become more. We currently have watches, laptops and mobile phones. We will be happy if you visit our project and write us your comments.


# How Do i Work
Take the Inspect and see our products in the Console section. We specify the price, model and color of each product, and if we have other features.


> Do you go to the store a lot?
Or do you do more online shopping?
We built our own little store here. We will be glad to see you :)
